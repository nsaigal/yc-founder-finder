1. Clear, Insightful Self-Description

	•	What they’re building or exploring — not just what but why.
	•	Their current inflection point or learning goals.
	•	Their worldview or mental models, especially around startups, product, or AI.

🔍 Signal: A personal site, thoughtful Twitter/X posts, Substack, or a YC application-style bio.

⸻

2. Builder-First, Technical Enough to Ship
They’ve built and shipped something meaningful — solo or as the technical founder. Could be:
	•	A SaaS app, side project, automation tool, agent, or open-source repo.
	•	Doesn’t have to be flashy — even a niche tool with a real user base counts.

🔍 Signal: GitHub activity, Product Hunt posts, or indie hacker blog posts.

⸻

3. Startup-Native, Indie-Curious
They default to fast iteration and doing things themselves. Ideally:
	•	Prioritized velocity > polish.
	•	Have worked at or founded early-stage startups, especially 0→1.
	•	Bonus if they’ve bootstrapped something or earned internet money.

🚫 Avoid: Career PMs or researchers who don’t ship.
✅ Lean toward: Hacker-news readers, weekend builders, people who talk about customer feedback loops.

⸻

4. Generalist with Surface Area
They’re not “just” an engineer or designer — they:
	•	Think about GTM, UX, infra, and storytelling.
	•	Wear multiple hats and enjoy context-switching.
	•	Can zoom in (debug) and zoom out (product vision).

🔍 Signal: Solo founder types, freelancers, ex-founders, or early employees wearing 3+ hats.

⸻

5. Deep Curiosity About AI + LLMs
Not just “AI is cool,” but:
	•	They’re running small experiments or tracking model updates.
	•	They think about where LLMs break down or where they’re overkill.
	•	Bonus if they have opinions on agent frameworks, fine-tuning, evals, etc.

✅ Signal: They’ve posted about LangChain, GPT-4o, open-source models, or use AI in their workflows.
